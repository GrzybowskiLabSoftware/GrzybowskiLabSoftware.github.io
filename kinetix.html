    <H3> Examples of chemical networks in Kinetix's format</H3>
        Brusselator oscillator (both files above represents the same reaction networks but different initial 
         concentration of one reactants leads to significantly different oscilation pattern): <br>
        <ul> 
        <li> <a href="../files/brusselator-A1.7.knx">Brusselator 1 (initial concentration of reactant A is 1.7) </a> </li>
        <li> <a href="../files/brusselator-A3.0.knx">Brusselator 2 (initial concentration of reactant A is 3.0) </a> </li>
        </ul>
